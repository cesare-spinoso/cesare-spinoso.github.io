The process of applying to Mila might at first look daunting, but if you get started early, it shouldn't be a problem at all! I recommend carefully reading the documentation that Mila provides [here](https://mila.quebec/en/cours/supervision/). Feel free to contact me if you have any questions about the application process (for either the professional or research Master's). I'd be happy to help out!
