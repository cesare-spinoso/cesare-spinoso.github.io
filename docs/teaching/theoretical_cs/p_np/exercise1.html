    <b>Exercise.</b> Show that the <b>\(\texttt{Longest-Path}\)</b> problem is
    <b>NP-Complete</b> by reducing it from the <b>\(\texttt{Hamiltonian-Cycle}\)</b>
    problem.
    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>\(\texttt{Longest-Path}\):</b> Given a graph \(G = (V, E)\), does \(G\)
            have a <em>simple path</em> of at least \(k\) edges?
            (A simple path has no repeating vertices.)
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>\(\texttt{Hamiltonian-Cycle}\):</b> Given a graph \(G = (V, E)\) and a
            vertex \(u \in V\), does \(G\) contain a Hamiltonian cycle that starts
            and ends at \(u\)?
            (A Hamiltonian cycle visits every vertex exactly once.)
        </li>
    </ul>
