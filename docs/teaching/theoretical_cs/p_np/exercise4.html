    <b>Exercise.</b> Show that the <b>\(\texttt{Clique}\)</b> problem is <b>NP-Complete</b> by reducing it from the <b>\(\texttt{Vertex-Cover}\)</b> problem.
    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>\(\texttt{Clique}\):</b> Given a graph \(G = (V, E)\) and a positive
            integer \(k\), does \(G\) have a clique of \(k\) vertices?
            (A clique is a subset \(V' \subseteq V\) such that every pair of
            vertices in \(V'\) is connected by an edge.)
        </li>
    </ul>
