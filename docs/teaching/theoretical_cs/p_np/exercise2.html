    <b>Exercise.</b> Show that <b>\(\texttt{Independent-Set}\)</b> is
    <b>NP-Complete</b> by reducing it from the
    <b>\(\texttt{3-SAT}\)</b> problem.
    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>\(\texttt{Independent-Set}\):</b> Given a graph \(G = (V, E)\) and a
            positive integer \(k\), does \(G\) have an independent set of \(k\)
            vertices?
            (An independent set is a subset \(V' \subseteq V\) such that no pair of
            vertices in \(V'\) is connected by an edge.)
        </li>
    </ul>
