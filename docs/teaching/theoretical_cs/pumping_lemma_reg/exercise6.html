    <b>Exercise.</b> Let \(L = \{a^nb^kc^{n+k}d^p : n,k,p \geq 0\} \) be a language we are trying to show is not regular using the pumping lemma. Suppose your opponent chooses an integer \(m > 0 \). Which of the following strings for \(w \) would be a suitable choice to show that \(L \) is not regular? Should you pump up or pump down?
    <ol>
        <li>\(w = a^mb^mc^m \)</li>
        <li>\(w = a^mb^m \)</li>
        <li>\(w = a^mc^m \)</li>
        <li>\(w = a^mb^{2m}c^md^m \)</li>
    </ol>
