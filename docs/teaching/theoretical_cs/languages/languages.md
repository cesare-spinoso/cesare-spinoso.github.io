This section will be about strings, languages and language operations. You can find the related notes [here](languages.pdf). **Note:** When discussing the empty string you may see with $$\lambda$$ or $$\varepsilon$$. Please be aware that these are the same string, namely the string of length 0.

<h4>Definitions and Properties</h4>

I first introduce what we mean by a string and a language in the context of theoretical computer science. I provide some common properties of these objects that will re-occur throughout the course.

<h4>Operations on languages</h4>

Much like sets, languages also have associated operations. I discuss some of these along with some exercises. Extra exercises are at the end of the handout for you to practice!
