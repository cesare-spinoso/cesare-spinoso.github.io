    <b>Exercise (Sipser).</b> Prove that \(L^2 \subseteq L\) iff \(L = L^+\). This is a good exercise
    to both practice your proving skills and get familiar with language operations.

    This is only a partial solution to give you a hint. Since this statement is an if and only if, you must prove both directions.
    <p>
        \(\Rightarrow\) Assume \(L^2 \subseteq L\). You must show that \(L^+ = L\). Recall the definition of \(L^+ = L \cup L^2 \cup \dots = \bigcup_{i=1}^{\infty} L^i\). The hint for this direction is to show that for any \(n \geq 2, L^n \subseteq L\). You can prove this by induction on \(n\). Once you've shown this, the main result should follow easily.

        \(\Leftarrow\) Follows almost entirely by definition.
