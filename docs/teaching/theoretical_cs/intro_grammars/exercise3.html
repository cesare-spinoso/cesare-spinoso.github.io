    <b>Exercise.</b> In the slides, we provide an algorithm to convert an NFA to a RLG and another to convert a RLG to an NFA. Provide two algorithms that do the same thing but this time for left-linear grammars. That is, 1. construct an algorithm \(A_1\) that converts an NFA \(N\) to a LLG grammar \(G\) and 2. an algorithm \(A_2\) that converts a LLG \(G\) to an NFA \(N\). In both 1. and 2., \(L(N) = L(G)\).
