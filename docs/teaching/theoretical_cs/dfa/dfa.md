This section will be about Deterministic Finite Automata (DFA) and regular languages, a family of languages that are tightly connected to DFAs. You can find the notes related to this section (also partially transcribed on this page) [here](dfa.pdf).

<h4>What's a DFA?</h4>

A DFA is the most "primitive" computational machine that we will see in the course. This machine performs a sequence of deterministic operations given an input - a string - which leads to it either outputting "accept" or "reject". The language recognized or accepted by a DFA is the set of strings that the DFA accepts. A DFA also has a finite amount of memory. We will see that this will prove to be its major limitation in accepting more complex languages. The formal definition of a DFA is as follows

**Definition.** A **deterministic finite automata (DFA)** $$M$$ is a 5 element tuple $$M = (Q, \Sigma, \delta, q_0, F)$$ where
- $$Q$$ is the set of states of $$M$$
- $$\Sigma$$ is the alphabet of the strings inputted into $$M$$
- $$\delta: Q \times \Sigma \rightarrow Q$$ is the transition function of $$M$$
	- This can be represented graphically as we will see shortly or in a table.
- $$q_0$$ is the initial state, where computations begin
- $$F$$ is the set of accept or final states

<h4>An example DFA</h4>

**Example.** Here is an example of a DFA $$M_1 = (\{q_0, q_1, q_2\}, \{0,1\}, \delta, q_0, \{q_1\})$$ where we represent $$\delta$$ graphically as follows

What happens when this machine receives $$ 010 $$ as an input? What about $$ 101 $$?

<h4>Regular languages</h4>

We know DFAs as language acceptors or recognizers. In fact, languages that can accepted by DFAs belong to the family of **regular languages**. You can think of this family as containing languages that are "simple enough" to be recognized by a DFA. We have thus already begun creating a hierarchy of computational power with the DFA at the bottom of this hierarchy. In other words, there appears to be a relationship between the "complexity" of a language and the "power" required for a DFA to accept it. This should give you the idea that there are perhaps more complicated languages that cannot be accepted by a DFA. Can you think of any?
