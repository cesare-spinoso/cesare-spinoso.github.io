    <b>Exercise. (Sipser 1.35)</b> Let \(A/B = \{ w : wx \in A \text{ for some } x \in B \}\). Show that if \(A\) is
    regular and
    \(B\)
    is any language, then \(A/B\) is regular.

    <ul>
        <li>Since A is regular we know that there exists a DFA \(M_A = (Q_A, \Sigma, \delta_A, q_0, F_A)\) that
            accepts it. Next,
            we create a new and improved extended transition function \(\delta' : Q \times \Sigma^{*}
            \rightarrow Q\). This
            transition function is extended because it accepts as input a state \(q \in Q_A\) and a string
            \(w \in
            \Sigma^*\). As its output, the transition function returns the state \(q'\) that \(M_A\) would be in had
            it read \(w\)
            starting from \(q\). The goal is to create a machine \(M\) that accepts \(A/B\). If \(y \in A/B\) then
            we know that when
            we feed \(y\) into \(M_A\) we get to state \(q' = \delta'(q_0, w)\). Once at state \(q'\), we take some
            string \(x \in
            B\) and feed it to \(M_A\) but now starting from \(q'\). It must be that \(\delta'(q', x) = q_f \in
            F_A\) (by definition
            of \(A/B\)). Thus the machine \(M = (Q_A, \Sigma, \delta_A, q_0, F)\) accepting \(A/B\) is the same as
            the machine
            accepting \(A\) except that \begin{align} F = \{ q : \exists x \in B, \delta'(q, x) \in F \}
            \end{align}</li>
        <li>**NOTE**: It doesn't matter here that \(B\) is not regular. We are not using the fact that a machine
            does (or doesn't)
            accept \(B\). We are simply using its contents to define a new \(F\), a set of final **states**. All the
            computation,
            however, is done on \(M_A\) which we know exists. So we aren't using anything that's more "powerful"
            than the class of
            regular languages.</li>
