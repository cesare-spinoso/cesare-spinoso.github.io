This section will be about some math preliminaries that you will be using throughout the course. You can get the notes for these videos [here](math.pdf).

<h3>Set Theory</h3>

<h4>Definitions and properties</h4>

Sets will be everywhere in this course. I introduce basic notions related to sets such as their definition as well as some of their properties.

<h4>Set operations</h4>

Now that you know what sets are, I introduce operations that you can use on sets such as the union, intersection and set difference. Exercises at the end of the video for you to practice!

<h3>Graph Theory</h3>

Along with sets, graphs will be another fundamental mathematical object you'll be seeing throughout this course. I review some definitions of sets and talk about the different ways of "walking" and "cycling" through graphs.

<h3>(Some) Proof Techniques</h3>

Finally, proofs will be another big part of the material in this course. I provide a review of some fundamental proof techniques.

<h4>Proving that two sets are equal</h4>

How do you prove that two sets are equal? I discuss this and provide an example to make things a little more concrete.

<h4>The Pigeonhole Principle</h4>

The Pigeonhole Principle (PHP) is a simple yet powerful concept that you will find in multiple proofs for this course. I discuss the principle and how it can used to prove a property about simple graphs.

<h4>Using the PHP to prove a statement about graphs</h4>

<h4>Proof by contradiction</h4>

If you took any type of discrete math class, you used this technique to prove that $$\sqrt{2}$$ is irrational! I discuss the general idea of proving something by contradiction and then provide a proof by contradiction for a statement on graphs.

<h4>Proof by induction</h4>

Used to prove statements on integers (among other things), the proof by induction is a powerful proof technique that I review with another graph theory proof.

<h4>The Principle of Mathematical Induction</h4>

<h4>Using induction to prove a statement about trees</h4>

<h4>Proof by construction</h4>

Last but not least, the proof by construction, in which you construct a mathematical object to prove its existence, is the one that you will be seeing the most in this course.
