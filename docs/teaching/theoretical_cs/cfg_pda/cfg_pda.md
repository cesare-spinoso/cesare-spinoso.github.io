In this section, we look at the (quite remarkable) result that context-free grammars and non-deterministic pushdown automata are equivalent in terms of expressive power. That is, the set of languages which can be generated by context-free grammars is *exactly the same* as the set of languages which can be recognized by non-deterministic pushdown automata. The reason why I think this result is quite remarkable is because of how different CFGs and PDAs look like *on the surface*. We will see, however, that there exsits conversion algorithms from both CFGs to PDA and vice-versa.

# Converting context-free grammars to pushdown automata

In this first subsection, I will discuss the conversion of CFGs to equivalent PDA. Since I gave a guest lecture on just this topic in Comp 330 during the Fall 2025 semester, I am bookmarking the important sections of that recording below.

# Conveting pushdown automata to context-free grammars

Unfortunately, I ran out of time in the guest lecture above before I could get to the PDA-to-CFG conversion algorithm. Here are [the handwritten notes](PDA to CFG.pdf) I was planning on using for that part.
