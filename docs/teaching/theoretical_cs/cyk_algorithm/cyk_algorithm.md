In this section, we will discuss the CYK**S**[^1] algorithm. This algorithm, which relies on a context-free grammar $$G$$ being in *Chomsky normal form* (See [the previous section]({{ "/teaching/theoretical_cs/normal_forms" | relative_url }})), determines whether 1. A string $$w$$ belongs to the language generated by the grammar and 2. Derives **all** the parse trees that yield that string.

# Intuitions behind the algorithm

In this first video, I give you the general intuitions about the CYKS algorithm by first presenting the recursive nature of the algorithm and then by looking at an example where I build the parse tree bottom-up. Note that this is only an *intuitive* presentation of the algorithm since, in general, in requires the construction of a dynamic programming table. We will look at that in the following sub-section.

# Running the CYKS algorithm 

In this video, I run the CYKS algorithm on the following grammar `G` which has already by converted to CNF. To do so, I present the CYKS algorithm in a slightly more formal way, discussing its **dynamic programming** table. This recording comes from an in-person tutorial that I gave in Fall 2025. The video starts at the right place for your convenience.

### Exercises

**Exercise.** Convert the following grammar `G` to CNF and run the CYKS algorithm on `G` using `w = aaa`.

```
Grammar G:
    S -> aAa | bBb | epsilon
    A -> C | a
    B -> C | b
    C -> CDE | epsilon
    D -> A | B | ab
```
