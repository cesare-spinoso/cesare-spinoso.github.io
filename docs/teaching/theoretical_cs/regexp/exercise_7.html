<div id="question_7">
    <p><b>Exercise.</b> In the introductory video, an example of an invalid regular expression I gave had something like \((abb)^R\) in it where \(R\) was the "reversal" operator. This was indeed not a <i>standard</i> valid regular expression because it wasn't clear what the reversal operator applied to a regular expression would give you. This question asks you to provide a formal definition of this operator. That is, provide a (recursive) definition of the regular expression reversal operation and show how, based on your definition, \(L(r^R) = (L(r))^R\).</p>

    <p>No solution for this one yet! It's meant to make you think about what regular expressions really are and how they map to languages.</p>
    <p>This question was inspired by one of the brilliant students that took Comp 330 at McGill during the Fall 2022 semester.</p>
