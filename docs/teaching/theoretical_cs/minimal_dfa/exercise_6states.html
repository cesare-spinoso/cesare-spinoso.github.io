    <b>Exercise.</b> Prove that any DFA that accepts the language \(L = \{w \in \Sigma^* : w \text{ starts with 01 and ends with 10}\}\)
    <b>must</b> have at least 6 states.

        To prove this, you might have simply created a DFA and applied the state reduction algorithm. This is correct, but you should understand <i>why</i> the produced DFA is minimal (see the Myhill-Nerode section). But there is a more direct way of showing this! The proof technique that I give is applicable in general and contains some of the intuition on how you would prove the correctness of the state reduction algorithm.
