    <b>Exercise.</b> Prove that any DFA that accepts the language \(L = \{w \in \Sigma^* : w \text{ starts with 01 and ends with 10}\}\)
    <b>must</b> have at least 6 states.

        To prove this, you might have simply created a DFA and applied the state reduction algorithm.
        But there is a more direct way of showing this! Firstly, we must build a DFA that accepts the language \(L\)
        and that has exactly 6 states. If you're struggling on this part, no worries! Check out the solution video
        in the DFA section. Once you have a DFA that accepts \(L\) and has exactly 6 states, you can prove, by
        contradiction, that there cannot be a DFA that accepts \(L\) and has fewer than 6 states. The proof
        technique that I give is applicable in general and is in fact how you would prove the correctness of
        the state reduction algorithm.
