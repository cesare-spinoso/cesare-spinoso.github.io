I have had the pleasure to tutor students and TA classes in different areas of Mathematics and Computer Science. Some of my teaching material is available on my [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/cesarespinoso/playlists).

## Theoretical Computer Science

I had the pleasure of serving as a TA for the theoretical computer science classes at both Concordia and McGill. I have developed a dedicated webpage for this material (still a work in progress) which you can find [here]( {{ "/teaching/theoretical_cs" | relative_url }}).

### Theory of Computation (Comp 330)
I had the pleasure of serving as a TA for the Theory of Computation class at McGill University (also known as COMP 330) during the Fall 2022 and Winter 2023 term during which I held office hours, graded assignments and the midterm/final exam as well as *guest lectured for [Prof. Panangaden](https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~prakash/)*. I am excited to be serving as a co-instructor for the course during the Fall 2023 semester. This course has a significant amount of overlap with its Concordia counterpart, but also diverges in the second half where more emphasis is placed on computability and reductions.

### Introduction to Theoretical Computer Science (Comp 335)
I had the pleasure of serving as a TA for the (Intro to) Theoretical Computer Science class at Concordia University (known as COMP 335) on three occasions (Summer 2020, Fall 2020 and Summer 2021) during which I held tutorial sessions and graded assignments. Each of these semesters have playlists on my channel which include tutorial recordings and midterm/final exam review videos. You can also find some of the material that I developed with [Tianyi Liu](https://ca.linkedin.com/in/tianyi-liu-705048186) and [Prof. Nematollaah Shiri](https://www.concordia.ca/ginacody/computer-science-software-eng/faculty.html?fpid=nematollaah-shiri) at the following [address](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1JDx-N63TB6Ey59NOw2VOIpV4azLk9fo2?usp=sharing).

## Discrete mathematics/Linear Algebra (Comp 232/Math 251)
I developed some additional resources related to discrete mathematics (e.g., mathematical induction) and linear algebra (e.g., linear subspaces) that I continue to use in my tutoring work. Both can be found on my channel.

## Suggestions
If you have any suggestions for my teaching material, feel free to contact me. I am always open to new ideas and would love to hear from you!
