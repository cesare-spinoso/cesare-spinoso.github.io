I have had the pleasure to tutor students, TA and teach classes in different areas of Mathematics and Computer Science. Some of my teaching material is available on my [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/cesarespinoso/playlists).

## Theoretical Computer Science

I had the pleasure of serving as a TA and instructor for the theoretical computer science classes at both Concordia and McGill. I have developed a dedicated webpage for this material (still a work in progress) which you can find [here]( {{ "/teaching/theoretical_cs" | relative_url }}).

### Theory of Computation (Comp 330)
I was extremely lucky to teach the Theory of Computation class at McGill University (also known as Comp 330) during the Fall 2023 semester. I had an unbelievably good time and I hope my students did as well! I have collected a few of my favourite moments and have posted them [here]({{ "/teaching/comp330/fall2023" | relative_url }}).

In addition to teaching the course, I had the pleasure of serving as a TA for [Prof. Panangaden](https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~prakash/) in the Fall 2022 term and [Prof. Cr√©peau](https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~crepeau/index_en.html) in the Winter 2023 term. I held office hours, graded assignments and exams as well as *guest lectured for Prof. Panangaden* on the Myhill-Nerode theorem. I am excited to TA this class again in the Winter 2024 term.

### Introduction to Theoretical Computer Science (Comp 335)

I had the pleasure of serving as a TA for the (Intro to) Theoretical Computer Science class at Concordia University (known as COMP 335) on three occasions (Summer 2020, Fall 2020 and Summer 2021) during which I held tutorial sessions and graded assignments. Each of these semesters have playlists on my channel which include tutorial recordings and midterm/final exam review videos. You can also find some of the material that I developed with [Tianyi Liu](https://ca.linkedin.com/in/tianyi-liu-705048186) and [Prof. Nematollaah Shiri](https://www.concordia.ca/ginacody/computer-science-software-eng/faculty.html?fpid=nematollaah-shiri) [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1JDx-N63TB6Ey59NOw2VOIpV4azLk9fo2?usp=sharing).

## Discrete mathematics/Linear Algebra (Comp 232/Math 251)

I developed some additional resources related to discrete mathematics (e.g., mathematical induction) and linear algebra (e.g., linear subspaces) that I continue to use in my tutoring work. Both can be found on my channel.

## Suggestions

If you have any suggestions for my teaching material, feel free to contact me. I am always open to new ideas and would love to hear from you!
