I have had the pleasure to tutor students, TA and teach classes in different areas of Mathematics and Computer Science. Some of my teaching material is available on my [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/cesarespinoso/playlists).

## Theoretical Computer Science

I had the pleasure of serving as a TA and instructor for the theoretical computer science classes at both Concordia and McGill. I have developed a dedicated webpage for this material [which you can find here]( {{ "/teaching/theoretical_cs" | relative_url }}). I have **finally** added more content which should be helpful to future students taking an intro to theoretical CS class 🎉!

### Theory of Computation (Comp 330)

I was extremely lucky to teach the Theory of Computation class at McGill University (also known as Comp 330) during the Fall 2023 semester. I had an unbelievably good time and I hope my students did as well! I have collected a few of my favourite moments and [have posted them here]({{ "2023/12/14/my_experience_teaching.html" | relative_url }}). The [**class webpage** can be found here]({{ "teaching/comp330/fall2023" | relative_url }}).

In addition to having taught the course, I have TAed it 6 times already and have received [two TA awards in the process](https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/academic/ta/awards/winners/) (Fall 2022 and Fall 2024).

### Introduction to Theoretical Computer Science (Comp 335)

I had the pleasure of serving as a TA for the (Intro to) Theoretical Computer Science class at Concordia University (known as COMP 335) on three occasions during which I held tutorial sessions and graded assignments. Each of these semesters have playlists on my channel which include tutorial recordings and midterm/final exam review videos. 
- Summer 2020 - [YouTube Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzmPQTTtMivhi5VvlGb3WDJGKUQNqDyWz)
- Fall 2020 - [YouTube Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzmPQTTtMivji1ootK08Aj2vKsn57MBLK)
- Summer 2021 - [YouTube Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzmPQTTtMivimtPqhMkV-aETPYDj_803G)

You can find [some of the material for the tutorials here]((https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1JDx-N63TB6Ey59NOw2VOIpV4azLk9fo2?usp=sharing)). Thanks to [Tianyi Liu](https://ca.linkedin.com/in/tianyi-liu-705048186) and [Prof. Nematollaah Shiri](https://www.concordia.ca/ginacody/computer-science-software-eng/faculty.html?fpid=nematollaah-shiri) for having helped develop it. In addition, I am extremely grateful to Prof. Shiri as I don't think I would have ever TAed this class in the first place without his help and support.

## Discrete mathematics/Linear Algebra (Comp 232/Math 251)

I developed some additional resources related to [discrete mathematics](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzmPQTTtMivivPgsNZxAhBDZEqjD4ppJ0) (e.g., mathematical induction) and [linear algebra](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzmPQTTtMivgw_sM-DUV2hobPi-NAJjsF) (e.g., linear subspaces).

## Suggestions

If you have any suggestions for my teaching material, feel free to contact me. I am always open to new ideas and would love to hear from you!
