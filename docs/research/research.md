I am interested in developing statistical as well as language-based computational methods to help scientists further their research. This interest began during my undergrad and has continued during my master's where I most recently developed language techniques to assist qualitative researchers in conducting qualitative analyses. Here is a list of my most recent publications.

#### Mental Healthâ€“Related Emergency Department Visits in Adolescents Before and During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Multicentric Retrospective Study (2021)

Nicholas Chadi, **Cesare Spinoso-Di Piano**, Esli Osmanlliu, Jocelyn Gravel, Olivier Drouin, "Mental Healthâ€“Related Emergency Department Visits in Adolescents Before and During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Multicentric Retrospective Study", *Journal of Adolescent Health*, Volume 69, Issue 5, 2021, doi:10.1016/j.jadohealth.2021.07.036 [ðŸ”—](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1054139X21003931)

This publication was the result of work conducted with [Dr. Nicholas Chadi](https://nicholaschadi.com/) and [Dr. Olivier Drouin](https://recherche.umontreal.ca/english/our-researchers/professors-directory/researcher/is/in31525/) while I was a data analyst at the [Research Centre of Sainte-Justine University Hospital](https://research.chusj.org/en/Home). Through our analyses, we showed a significant increase in adolescent eating-disorder-related emergency department visits between 2018-2019 (pre-pandemic) and 2020 (at the peak of the pandemic).
