I am interested in developing statistical as well as language-based computational methods to help scientists further their research. This interest began during my undergrad and has continued during my master's where I most recently developed language techniques to assist qualitative researchers in conducting qualitative analyses. Here is a list of my most recent publications.

<h3>Qualitative Code Suggestion: A Human-Centric Approach to Qualitative Coding (2023)</h3>

<b>Cesare Spinoso-Di Piano</b>, Samira Rahimi, and Jackie Cheung. 2023. <a href="https://aclanthology.org/2023.findings-emnlp.993/">Qualitative Code Suggestion: A Human-Centric Approach to Qualitative Coding.</a> In <i>Findings of the Association for Computational Linguistics</i>: EMNLP 2023, pages 14887–14909, Singapore. Association for Computational Linguistics.

This publication was the result of the work I carried out during my Master's at McGill with my wonderful advisors <a href="https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~jcheung/index.html">Jackie Cheung</a> and <a href="https://rahimislab.ca/">Samira Rahimi</a>. We showed that qualitative coding, a qualitative research technique, can be <b>partially</b> automated in a way which better aligns with the desires of scientists which frequently conduct these analyses.

<h3>McGill BabyLM Shared Task Submission: The Effects of Data Formatting and Structural Biases (2023)</h3>

Ziling Cheng, Rahul Aralikatte, Ian Porada, <b>Cesare Spinoso-Di Piano</b>, and Jackie CK Cheung. 2023. <a href="https://aclanthology.org/2023.conll-babylm.18/">McGill BabyLM Shared Task Submission: The Effects of Data Formatting and Structural Biases.</a> In <i>Proceedings of the BabyLM Challenge at the 27th Conference on Computational Natural Language Learning</i>, pages 179–192, Singapore. Association for Computational Linguistics.

This publication was the result of a project lead by the brilliant and tremendously hard-working Ziling Cheng in the context of the <a href="https://babylm.github.io/">BabyLM Challenge</a>. Through our experiments, we showed that more careful data preprocessing decisions can lead to performance increases of language models trained on very little amounts of data.

<h3>Mental Health–Related Emergency Department Visits in Adolescents Before and During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Multicentric Retrospective Study (2021)</h3>

Nicholas Chadi, <b>Cesare Spinoso-Di Piano</b>, Esli Osmanlliu, Jocelyn Gravel, Olivier Drouin, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1054139X21003931">"Mental Health–Related Emergency Department Visits in Adolescents Before and During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Multicentric Retrospective Study"</a>, <i>Journal of Adolescent Health</i>, Volume 69, Issue 5, 2021, doi:10.1016/j.jadohealth.2021.07.036

This publication was the result of work conducted with <a href="https://nicholaschadi.com/">Dr. Nicholas Chadi</a> and <a href="https://recherche.umontreal.ca/english/our-researchers/professors-directory/researcher/is/in31525/">Dr. Olivier Drouin</a> while I was a data analyst at the <a href="https://research.chusj.org/en/Home">Research Centre of Sainte-Justine University Hospital</a>. Through our analyses, we showed a significant increase in adolescent eating-disorder-related emergency department visits between 2018-2019 (pre-pandemic) and 2020 (at the peak of the pandemic).
