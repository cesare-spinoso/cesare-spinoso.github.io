Though I am only a graduate student, I have had the pleasure to tutor students and TA classes in different areas of Mathematics and Computer Science. Some of my teaching material is available on my [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/cesarespinoso/playlists).

## Theory of Computation (Comp 330)
I am happy to be serving as a TA for the Theory of Computation class at McGill Univeristy during the Fall 2022 semester. This course has a significant amount of overlap with its Concordia counterpart, but also diverges significantly in the second half where more emphasis is placed on decidability and reducibility. You can find a page specifically dedicated to this course.

## Theoretical Computer Science (Comp 335)
I had the pleasure of serving as a TA for the Theoretical Computer Science class at Concordia University (known as COMP 335) on three occasions (Summer 2020, Fall 2020 and Summer 2021). Each of those semesters have playlists on my channel which include tutorial recordings and midterm/final exam review videos. You can also find some of the material that I developed with Tianyi Liu and [Prof. Nematollaah Shiri](https://users.encs.concordia.ca/~shiri/) [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1JDx-N63TB6Ey59NOw2VOIpV4azLk9fo2?usp=sharing).

## Discrete mathematics/Linear Algebra (Comp 232/Math 251)
I developed some additional resources related to discrete mathematics (e.g., mathematical induction) and linear algebra (e.g., linear subspaces) that I continue to use in my tutoring work. Both can be found on my channel.

## Suggestions
If you have any suggestions for my teaching material, feel free to contact me. I am always open to new ideas and would love to hear from you!
