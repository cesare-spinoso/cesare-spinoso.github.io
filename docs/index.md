I'm a first-year PhD student at [McGill University](https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/) and [Mila](https://mila.quebec/en/) where I am advised by [Prof. Jackie Cheung](https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~jcheung/index.html). I am interested in ways of using and developing NLP techniques to further scientific research.

Before starting my PhD, I earned a master's degree in Computer Science from [McGill University](https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/) where I worked with Prof. Cheung along with [Prof. Samira Rahimi](https://rahimislab.ca/) on leveraging NLP techniques to assist health researchers in their analysis of patient-care data. Before my master's, I earned a bachelor's degree in Mathematics, Statistics and Computer Science (Joint Major) from [Concordia University](https://www.concordia.ca/).

In terms of research services, I am currently an organizer for the McGill NLP [reading group](https://mcgill-nlp.github.io/reading-group/) (really more of a seminar series). Before that, I was the organizer of the Mila Health and AI reading group (March 2022 to March 2023).
