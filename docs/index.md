Hello and welcome to my website! 

## About me
<img style="float:left;width:auto;height:300px;margin:10px"  src="cspino.png"/>
I'm currently a master's student at [McGill University](https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/) and [Mila](https://mila.quebec/en/) researching applications and extensions of natural language processing (NLP) to the field of medicine. I am supervised by [Prof. Jackie Cheung](https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~jcheung/index.html) and [Prof. Samira Rahimi](https://rahimislab.ca/). We are currently working on ways of integrating recent advances in NLP to assist health researchers in their analysis of patient-care data.

I was previously at [Concordia University](https://www.concordia.ca/) where I earned a Bachelor's degree in Mathematics, Statistics and Computer Science (Joint Major).
