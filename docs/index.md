I'm a PhD student at [McGill University](https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/) and [Mila](https://mila.quebec/en/) where I am advised by [Prof. Jackie Cheung](https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~jcheung/index.html). I am currently interested in computational pragmatics and world models.

Before starting my PhD, I earned a master's degree in Computer Science from [McGill University](https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/) where I worked with Prof. Cheung along with [Prof. Samira Rahimi](https://rahimislab.ca/) on leveraging NLP techniques to assist health researchers in their analysis of patient-care data. Before my master's, I earned a bachelor's degree in Mathematics, Statistics and Computer Science (Joint Major) from [Concordia University](https://www.concordia.ca/).

In terms of research services, I am currently an organizer for the McGill NLP [reading group](https://mcgill-nlp.github.io/reading-group/) (really more of a seminar series). Before that, I was the organizer of the Mila Health and AI reading group (March 2022 to March 2023).


## Recent News

- **October 2024**: I presented my paper *Does This Summary Answer My Question?

Poster and paper can be found [here](https://github.com/cesare-spinoso/RSASumm-CustomNLP4U).

- **July 2024**: Better late than never! I have made a [webpage]({{ "teaching/comp330/fall2023" | relative_url }}) for the Comp 330 (Theory of Computation) class I taught in the Fall 2023. Resources like lecture notes and assignments are now publicly accessible! This compliments a [previous post]({{ "2023/12/14/my_experience_teaching.html" | relative_url }}) I made recounting my teaching experience.

- **May 2024**: I gave a lecture on NLP to the 2024 cohort of [AI4Good](https://www.ai4goodlab.com/) students!
